- My design has a personalized calendar, news feed, current clock, and local weather. It also includes health-related information, such as weight. My design includes 6 sources of light. With these light sources, the user may toggle the sliders at the bottom of the mirror to the desired color they would like. The user additionally not only sees the current temperature, but the high, low, and what it feels like that day.
